## Overview

This repo contains exercises and projects completed as part of the Machine Learning course I am taking at NYU CUSP in Spring 2019. I'll be updating this repo throughout the spring. 

Also check out my repo "nyuProjects" (https://github.com/seeess1/nyuProjects) for examples of other work with pandas, geopandas, SQL, and ArcGIS.
