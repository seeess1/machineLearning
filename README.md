## Overview

This repo contains exercises and projects completed as part of the Machine Learning course I am taking at NYU CUSP in Spring 2019. I'll be updating this repo throughout the spring. 

Also check out my repos [nyuProjects](https://github.com/seeess1/nyuProjects "nyuProjects") and [bigData](https://github.com/seeess1/bigData "bigData") for more projects and work samples.
